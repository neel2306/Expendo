# Expendo

Managing funds as a student is somewhat hard as we tend to overspend. I have experienced the same and decided to build myself an expense tracker to keep myself accountable. This has helped me better manage my money, from going broke by the end to of the month to having a good lump sum throughout. This has helped me stay accountable with my spendings and it will surely help you stay accountable with your money as well!
